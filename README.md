# Git Basics - important steps for git workflow

Initialize a new repository with git init
Create changes to project files in the text editor
check status of those files with git status
stage changes for commits by command: git add (file name) or with a (.) to add all the file changes
commit changes to version history with command: git commit -m "Insert a brief message about the change made here"
review previous changes with git log (press q when ready to exit git log)
You can see the specific changes made to a file before commiting by using git diff

and if you need to remove a repository that has hidden and/or regular files in it, use command: rm -rf repository-name
